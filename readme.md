## Project kickstarter ##

This kickstarter allows you to create a complete web project folder structure with just a few keypresses. By default the generated structure is:

<pre>/
/assets
/assets/css
/assets/img
/assets/js
/assets/scss
/index.html</pre>

You are free to reconfigure this structure for each new project you start.

### Short instruction ###

First copy all files to your windows\system32 directory. 

Afterwards you can create a new folder for your project anywhere you want. 
Change to that folder, press SHIFT+RIGHTCLICK in an empty area of that folder and select "Open command window here". 
Type `kickstart` and select what you need!

If you decided to create sass/scss files you can start watching them by just typing `startwork` or just select "Start working" from the kickstarter options menu.


### Features ###

* Generate a full project folder structure (see above) with folders for your HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript and images in seconds!
* Create complete HTML5, XHTML or HTML4 templates with (if you like) links to the Google CDN version of jQuery and an empty stylesheet
* Create empty CSS and JavaScript that will be placed in the according folder
* Type in `startwork` to let SASS watch your scss changes. No more hassle with typing complicated stuff like `sass --watch path/to/my/scss:path/to/my/css`. SCSS directory is recognized automatically.


### Compatibility ###

All batch scripts were tested on a fresh Windows 7. Feel free to send bug reports if you find any.
