### Short instruction ###

First copy all files to your windows\system32 directory. 

Afterwards you can create a new project folder anywhere you want then press SHIFT+RIGHTCLICK in an empty area of that folder and select "Open command window here". Type in "kickstart" and select what you need. If you decided to create sass/scss files you can start watching them by typing in "startwork" or just select "Start working" from the kickstarter options menu.
